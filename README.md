# Diabatic-Detection
Diabetes in India is a growing health concern, with over half the population at risk of developing the condition at some point in their lives.

According to one 2021 review, people who live in cities and metropolitan areas in India are more likely to develop diabetes than ever before. This is due, in part, to cities promoting a lifestyle that can increase a person’s body mass index (BMI). Having a higher BMI is a diabetes risk factor.

Rural areas in India are also experiencing a surge in type 2 diabetes cases, but more studies are necessary to fully understand how and why this is happening.

The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having Diabate, with the help of Machine Learning. Classification algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine have been trained on the Pima Indian Diabates dataset, UCI Machine Learning repository. Logistics Regression performed well with better accuracy (78%), precision and recall. After hyper parameter tuning, application has deployed on Heroku with the help of Streamlit.

### Data Collection
Pima Indian Diabates Data Set from UCI Machine Learning/Kaggle

### Model Creation and Evaluation
*	Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine tested.
*	Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic regression were given better results. Random Forest was chosen for the final model training and testing.
*	Hyper parameter tuning was performed.
*	Model performance evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.


### Model Deployment
The final model is deployed using on Heroku using Streamlit framework
